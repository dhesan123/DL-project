THIS IS TO PREDICT THE GENDER OF AN PEOPLE IN NEURAL NETWORK CONCEPTS

Project Description: Gender Prediction using Neural Networks

In this project, a neural network model was trained to predict gender, utilizing a multiclass classification approach. The dataset likely contains features that can be used to predict the gender of an individual 
(e.g., height, weight, etc.). The model was evaluated using two key metrics: accuracy and loss, for both the training and validation sets.

- Model Accuracy: The graph on the left shows the model's accuracy over the epochs. Both training and validation accuracy seem to stabilize after a certain number of epochs, 
with the training accuracy slightly outperforming the validation accuracy. The accuracy plateaued after around 100 epochs, suggesting the model is reaching its optimal performance 
with no significant improvements afterward.
  
- Model Loss: The graph on the right depicts the loss, where both training and validation loss decrease rapidly within the first few epochs and gradually stabilize. The training loss 
consistently decreases, indicating the model is learning, while the validation loss stabilizes after a point, indicating no overfitting.

The overall goal of the project is to develop a robust neural network model capable of gender prediction based on input data.
